# Contributing Guidelines

**Don't** include assets whose license or copyright conflict with this
project's MIT license.

**Do** follow [git best practices][1] wherever possible.

**Do** feel free to pester the project maintainers about the PR if it
hasn't been responded to. Sometimes notifications can be missed.

**Don't** overuse vertical whitespace; avoid multiple sequential blank
lines.

**Don't** include more than one feature or fix in a single PR.

**Don't** include changes unrelated to the purpose of the PR. This
includes changing the project version number, adding lines to the
`.gitignore` file, or changing the indentation or formatting.

**Don't** open a new PR if changes are requested. Just push to the
same branch and the PR will be updated.

**Do** use `CONFIG.debug.hooks = True` to find applicable hooks
